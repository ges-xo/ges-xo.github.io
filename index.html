                        <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda was born January 16, 1980 in New York. He is an American actor, composer lyricist, and writer who created and starred in stage productions that blend modern musical forms, such as hip-hop, with classical musical theatre.

                        </p>
                     
                        <p>He was born to parents of Puerto Rican origin and grew up in a Hispanic neighbourhood in northern Manhattan. His father was a political consultant to several New York City mayors, and his mother was a psychologist. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In high school he won the lead tole in W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance and became a fixture in the school's drama program. He studied theatre at Wesleyan University, where he continued to perform in musicals and to write his own songs and shows. It was there that he created the first draft of the musical In the Heights, which was set in Washington Heights, a northern Manhattan neighbourhood similar to that of his childhood.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>After reading Ron Chernow's 2004 biography about Alexander Hamilton, he began creating a musical about the Founding Father. The resulting Hamilton was energetic and infectious, and it features a racially diverse set, with Lin-Manuel Miranda starring the title role.

                        </p>
        
                        <p>Later on, he contributed to the soundtrack for the Disney animated film Moana (2016), and he earned an Academy Award nomination - his first - for the song "How Far I'll Go". Also, in 2021, he wrote "Dos Orguitas" for the film Encanto, and the song earned him another Oscar nomination.</p>

                         <h2>Background of Alexander Hamilton</h2>
    
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>Alexander Hamilton was a transformative figure in American history, known for his intelligence, vision, and relentless drive. Born out of wedlock on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean in 1755, Hamilton’s early life was shaped by hardship, including the death of his mother and his father’s abandonment. Despite these challenges, his exceptional intellect and writing abilities caught the attention of local patrons, who helped send him to the American colonies for education. He enrolled at King’s College (now Columbia University) in New York, where he became actively involved in revolutionary politics, advocating for American independence from Britain.
        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        
During the American Revolution, Hamilton gained Washington’s trust and became a key advisor. His experience in the war deepened his belief in the need for a strong federal government, which he later championed as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. Hamilton’s contributions to the Federalist Papers, alongside James Madison and John Jay, were instrumental in persuading states to ratify the U.S. Constitution. In these essays, Hamilton argued for a centralised government that could manage its debts and resources.

As the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington, Hamilton’s financial plan reshaped the nation’s economic landscape. His policies laid the groundwork for the United States' modern economic system and created a foundation for its future growth. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hamilton’s personal life was equally dramatic. His affair with Maria Reynolds became one of the first major political sex scandals in American history, and his political enemies used it to tarnish his reputation. His rivalry with Aaron Burr, another ambitious politician, grew increasingly hostile. This animosity led to a fatal duel in 1804, where Burr shot Hamilton in Weehawken, New Jersey, leading to his death the next day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite his death, Hamilton's influence on American politics, economics, and governance has endured. His writings, particularly on federalism and economic policy, remain foundational texts for understanding the U.S. political system. Today, his legacy is celebrated as a visionary who helped shape the nation's identity, balancing revolutionary ideals with practical governance. His life and work continue to resonate, thanks to his monumental contributions to the founding of the United States.
